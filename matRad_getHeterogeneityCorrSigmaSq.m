% matRad calculation of Bragg peak degradation due to heterogeneities
% 
% call
%   sigmaSq = matRad_getHeterogeneityCorrSigmaSq(WET)
% 
% input
%   WET:        water equivalent thickness of heterogeneous structure, e.g. 
%               lung [mm]
%   Pmod:       modulation power [µm] (optional)
% 
% output
%   sigmaSq:    sigma squared [mm^2] for degradation of Bragg peak

% a = 1.43 [mm/sqrt(cm)] from Riccardos thesis, independent from proton energy
% (smaller a tightens the curve (smaller degradation), R80 stays at same position)
% a = 1.60 [mm/sqrt(cm)] = 1.6/sqrt(10) [sqrt(mm)] fits the measurements better
% 
% Pmod = a^2; 150-750 micrometer for swine lung from Witt et al.
% Pmod = 256 [µm] is equivalent to a = 1.6 [mm/sqrt(cm)]
