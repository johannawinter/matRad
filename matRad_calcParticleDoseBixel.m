% call
%   dose = matRad_calcParticleDoseBixel(radDepths,radialDist_sq,baseData)
%
% input
%   radDepths:      radiological depths
%   radialDist_sq:  squared radial distance in BEV from central ray
%   baseData:       base data required for particle dose calculation
%   pln:            matRad's pln struct
%
% output
%   dose:   particle dose at specified locations as linear vector
